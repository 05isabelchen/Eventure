# Eventure
Eventure is a comprehensive event management platform designed to streamline the entire event planning and coordination process. The application serves as a centralized dashboard where users can create, manage, and track events from conception to completion.

Eventure offers a multi-faceted approach to event management, featuring a main dashboard that provides real-time insights into event statistics and budget allocation across different phases (planning, active, completed). Users can create detailed events by specifying venues, dates, types (Professional, Corporate, Outreach, Social), expected attendance, and budgets. The platform includes sophisticated budget management tools that allow users to set total available budgets, track spending across event types, monitor allocation percentages, and receive smart budget suggestions with emergency reserve calculations.

The attendee management system enables comprehensive tracking of participant information, RSVP statuses (confirmed, pending, declined), and provides filtering and export capabilities. A dedicated RSVP portal allows external users to view available events and register with their contact information and special requirements. The platform emphasizes real-time updates and live tracking, with features like expandable event lists, search functionality, and mobile-responsive design. Overall, Eventure appears to be designed for organizations or individuals who regularly host multiple events and need a professional tool to manage budgets, track attendees, coordinate logistics, and maintain oversight of their entire event portfolio through an intuitive, modern web interface.
